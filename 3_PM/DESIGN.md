Have a todo component that has prop of array that contains objects that look like: todo1 = {name: //todo name, id = //todo id}. Also have a deletes prop of the same component, with deletes being an array of unique ids. 
To add a todo just set the state of the todo component to a new state by pushing a new element to the end of the array (do the same to the deletes arary)
To search for todos use filtering to return all elements that begin with substring that is typed in the search bar
Lastly, to delete, get the id of the delete button that was clicked, remove that delete element from the deletes prop and also remove that element from the todos array.
